# 🌌 The Strategic Architect: Mohammad Zaryab

Welcome to the digital command center—where Operations Leadership meets Advanced Software Architecture. This portfolio is the result of merging free will, high-end AI, and a vision to deploy excellence.

This isn't just a portfolio; it's a high-performance system designed to showcase how I bridge the gap between scaling teams (23+ FTE) and engineering scalable code.

## 🚀 Live Deployment
👉 [mohdzaryab-portfolio.vercel.app](https://mohdzaryab-portfolio.vercel.app)

## 🧠 The Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Motion**: Framer Motion (60fps Physics-based animations)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Midnight Slate Theme)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## 🤔 Why This Portfolio?
Because a standard CV can't capture the gravity of managing U.S. P&C Insurance Ops while building full-stack logic. It’s built for those who value efficiency, strategy, and bold execution.
